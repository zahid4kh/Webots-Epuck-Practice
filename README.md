# Webots Epuck Practice

Welcome to my Webots practice repository! I'm diving into robot programming using the **e-puck robot** in Webots as part of my learning journey. ðŸš€

## Why this repo?

I'm using this repository to track my progress as I work through Webots tutorials and experiment with different e-puck behaviors. The idea is to build a strong foundation in robot programming before moving on to something more complex, like a humanoid robot. This is where I'll be sharing:

- Practice code for e-puck simulations

## The Goal

At the end of this journey, I aim to:
1. Complete Webots e-puck tutorials
2. Gain a solid understanding of robot programming
3. Start programming a humanoid robot from scratch

## How to Use This Repo

If you're a beginner like me, feel free to check out the code and learn alongside me! Otherwise, any feedback or suggestions are more than welcome. 

## Roadmap

1. **Complete Webots tutorials**: e-puck navigation, sensors, and more
2. **Experiment**: Tweak, break, and fix the simulations
3. **Humanoid robot**: Apply everything I've learned to build and program a humanoid

## Stay tuned

I'll be adding updates regularly as I learn more. Let's see where this journey takes me!
